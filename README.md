# Unsupervised ML Project

This project explores unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze and extract insights from data. It is built using Python, utilizes various libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks, and leverages an API to interact with the data. The dataset focuses on automated devices (ATMs) and their accessibility for people with disabilities.

## Project Files
