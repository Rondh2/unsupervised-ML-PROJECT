# Unsupervised ML Project

This project explores unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze and extract insights from data. It is built using Python and utilizes various libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks.

## Project Files
- `MLPROJECT.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the ML models and analysis.
- `ML Project.pdf`: A report summarizing the methodology, results, and conclusions of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all required Python packages for running the project.
- `data_fetcher.py`: A Python script to fetch data from an API and preprocess it for analysis.

## Features
- Data fetching and preprocessing via API integration.
- Implementation of unsupervised ML models, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- Data visualization to explore insights.
  
## API Integration
This project includes functionality to fetch data via an API. To configure the API:
1. Set the API URL and authentication details in the `data_fetcher.py` script.
2. Ensure your API key (if required) is stored securely, for example, using environment variables.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Install dependencies using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
